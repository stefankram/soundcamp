# soundcamp
Soundcamp is a music collaboration platform that is designed to facilitate the creation, building, and distribution of music between users. The idea of this platform came from mixing features of Soundcloud and Bandcamp hence the name *Soundcamp*. The goal of the project is for users to create and join bands (similar to groups in Facebook) and create songs with their fellow band members. Each song is similar to a Github project in which band members can commit additions to the song or fork the song allowing multiple versions to be created. Once a band finishes a song or a set of songs, they can distribute them for free or sell them to other users.
